A piece of code made for a Teensy/Pro Micro.

THIS PIECE OF CODE IS FOR EDUCATIONAL PURPOSES ONLY & ANYTHING YOU DO WITH THE CODE IS ON YOUR OWN BACK AS I DO NOT WISH FOR THIS TO BE USED IN A MALICIOUS WAY.. YOU HAVE BEEN WARNED.

Note: this is not going to be used for malicious intent, it is for one of my upcoming blog posts about ways a pentester can use different hardware/code.
